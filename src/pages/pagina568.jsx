          <p>
            My parents, Sarah and John, were both born in the small town of Brookville.
            Mom was born there in 1958, and Dad followed suit in 1955. The wedding
            ceremony was held at a charming chapel near the town square. Mom was 22
            years old, and Dad was 25 at the time of their wedding. It was a beautiful
            ceremony, filled with joy and surrounded by family and friends.
